# AILang

A natural language programming system designed for execution by AI systems.

## What is AILang?

AILang is a programming language that uses structured English instead of traditional programming syntax. Programs are written in controlled natural language that AI systems can directly interpret and execute without compilation.

## The Core Paradigm

Traditional programming requires translating human intent through artificial syntax, compilation, and machine code execution. AILang inverts this model by recognizing that modern AI systems are sophisticated computational engines capable of directly processing human logical intent expressed in natural language.

AILang operates on a **hybrid deterministic-intelligent architecture**:

- **Deterministic Layer**: Core operations (variables, control flow, I/O) execute identically every time, providing reliability
- **Intelligent Layer**: Specific constructs delegate decision-making to AI intelligence, using deterministic data as context

This means programs can have both predictable computational behavior and intelligent adaptability where explicitly designed.

## How AILang Works

AILang uses a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) execution model**. The complete language specification serves as a knowledge base that the AI system references during program execution. This ensures consistent interpretation of instructions while allowing intelligent decision-making within defined boundaries.

The AI retrieves exact behavioral definitions for each language construct, transforming from an unpredictable creative system into a reliable computational processor that follows precise rules while retaining intelligent adaptability where explicitly permitted.

## Production-Ready AI

The major advantage of AILang is that it enables AI to be used in production environments by constraining AI operations to **known boundaries**. Traditional AI systems are unpredictable and cannot be responsibly deployed in production because their outputs are random and unreliable.

AILang solves this through its RAG architecture: the AI retrieves exact behavioral definitions from the specification, ensuring deterministic operations behave consistently while allowing intelligent adaptation only where explicitly permitted. This transforms AI from an unpredictable creative system into a reliable computational processor that operates within defined constraints.

## Getting Started

To understand how to write AILang programs, **see the complete language specification** in `AILang_Specification.md`. The specification contains:

- Complete syntax and language constructs
- Data types and operators
- Control flow structures
- Input/output operations
- Intelligent programming constructs
- Detailed examples and use cases
- Implementation guidelines for AI systems

## How You Use AILang

To use AILang:

1. **Attach the specification**: Provide the complete AILang specification document to your AI system as a knowledge base
2. **Write your program**: Create AILang code using the syntax described in the specification
3. **Execute**: Run your program through either:
   - **AI Web Interface**: Paste your AILang code directly into conversational AI interfaces (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.)
   - **API Integration**: Submit AILang programs via API calls to AI systems for programmatic execution

The AI will use the specification to interpret and execute your program, following deterministic rules for core operations while applying intelligence where your code explicitly requests it.

## Worked Example

This repository includes practical examples demonstrating AILang's hybrid deterministic-intelligent capabilities. These can be executed by providing the AILang specification and the program to an AI system, along with any required input documents.

- **Rent Increase Negotiation** (`examples/negotiate_rent_increase/`): An AILang program that intelligently negotiates a rent increase by:
  - Deterministically retrieving tenant details, parsing rent increase notices, and gathering market/inflation data.
  - Intelligently assessing fairness, affordability, and negotiation leverage.
  - Adaptively generating counter-offer emails and reports, with conditional loops for ongoing negotiations.
  - Handling errors intelligently while maintaining privacy and legal compliance.

  The example folder includes:
  - `negotiate_rent_increase.ailang`: The main AILang program.
  - Input files: `landlord_email.pdf` (rent increase notice), `tenant_details.json`, `local_rent_data.json`, `cost_of_living_index.json`, `tenant_rights_laws.md`.
  - Output files (generated by execution): `counteroffer_email_to_landlord.txt`, `negotiation_report.json`.

  This example showcases real-world application in tenant-landlord negotiations, using UK-specific data and laws as of August 2025.
