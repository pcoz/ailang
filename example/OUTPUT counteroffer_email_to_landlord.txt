Subject: Response to Section 13 notice – proposal for fair and affordable rent adjustment

Dear John Landlord,

Thank you for your letter dated 15 August 2025 proposing to increase the rent for Flat 3, 45 Example Street, Hackney, London E8 1AB by 15% to £2,000 from 1 October 2025.

I value our good relationship and would like to agree a fair adjustment in line with current market conditions and affordability:

• Current rent: £2,000
• Proposed by landlord: £2,000 (+15%)
• CPI (ONS, July 2025): 3.8% (CPI rose from 3.6% in June to 3.8% in July 2025)
• Hackney one‑bed average (ONS / portals, 2025-08): £2,200 (annual change 8.6%)
• Comparable listings: Homerton E9 £1,950, Dalston E8 £2,200, London Fields £2,250, Bethnal Green E2 £2,100
• 30% affordability guideline: £750 per month based on my income

On this basis, I propose the following compromise:
1) £2,000 per month for the next six months (CPI‑anchored and within local comps), then
2) £2,040 per month for the subsequent six months, subject to no material disrepair or service reductions.

This keeps the rent aligned with inflation and the local market while remaining affordable, and avoids the need to apply to the First‑tier Tribunal under Section 13 of the Housing Act 1988. If you prefer a single figure, I can agree to £2,000 per month for 12 months with a review thereafter.

Please let me know if you are willing to accept this proposal. I am happy to discuss and finalise the paperwork.

Kind regards,
Alex Tenant
