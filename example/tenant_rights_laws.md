**Tenant Rights for Rent Increases in London (England) as of August 2025**

Based on guidance from Citizens Advice and GOV.UK.

### Legal Rights
- For assured shorthold tenancies (most private rentals starting after 15 January 1989): Landlords can increase rent only under specific conditions.
- During fixed-term tenancy: Only if the agreement includes a rent review clause or with tenant's agreement.
- After fixed term (periodic tenancy): Via Section 13 notice or a new agreement.
- For periodic tenancies: Increases limited to once every 52 weeks.
- If living with landlord: Fewer protections; rent can be increased more freely after fixed term.

### Notice Periods
- Section 13 notice requires: 6 months for yearly tenancies, 1 month for monthly, etc.
- Use Form 4 from GOV.UK: https://www.gov.uk/guidance/assured-tenancy-forms#form-4

### Limits or Caps
- No strict caps, but increases must be "fair" – aligned with local market rates for similar properties.
- Recent reforms (Renters Reform Bill updates as of 2024-2025): Enhanced protections against excessive increases, but no fixed percentage cap; emphasis on market fairness.
- Unfair if above market rates or during fixed term without clause.

### How to Challenge
- Appeal to First-tier Tribunal (Property Chamber) for free before increase takes effect: https://www.gov.uk/housing/paying-rent/challenging-a-rent-increase/
- Provide evidence of local rents from property websites.
- Do not withhold current rent to avoid arrears and eviction risk.

### Negotiation Tips
- Use market data to propose lower increase (e.g., if proposed £800 from £750, counter with £775).
- Check affordability; if on benefits, inform council for Housing Benefit/Universal Credit adjustments.

### Support
- Citizens Advice: https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/about-us/contact-us/contact-us/contact-us/ or nearest branch.
- Shelter or Tenants Union for London-specific advice.

No major new caps introduced in 2025; focus remains on tribunal challenges for unfairness.
