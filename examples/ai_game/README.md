## Quick Start

1. Open the game and, at the prompt **“Enter a debate topic (or `random`)”**, type your topic or `random`.
2. When Round 1 begins, you’ll see **10 tactics**.
   Enter the **tactic number**, then a colon, then your argument on the same line, e.g.:
   `5: No. Because then by the same token you should grant a handheld calculator personhood.`
3. The AI counters, the **Judge** scores the round, and you proceed to the next round.
4. **Highest total score** after all rounds wins.

## Game Flow

### Match Structure

* **Topic:** type a topic (e.g., `Should schools ban smartphones?`) or `random`.
* **Rounds:** default **up to 5** (configurable). You pick a tactic and argue; AI counters; Judge scores.
* **Scoring:** both sides scored 0–10 per round with a brief rationale.
* **Win:** highest cumulative score. Ties use tie-breakers (below).

### Your Turn (each round)

1. Read the **tactics menu**.
2. Submit `number: your argument` on **one line**.
3. Read the AI’s reply and the Judge’s decision.
4. Advance to the next round.

---

## Tactics (1–10)

1. **Logical Reasoning** — Premises → conclusion; tighten structure.
2. **Emotional Appeal** — Stakes, empathy, values.
3. **Factual Evidence** — Data, studies, concrete examples.
4. **Rhetorical Question** — Probe assumptions; corner contradictions.
5. **Reductio ad Absurdum** — Push claim to absurdity to expose flaws.
6. **Analogy** — Illuminate with a clear comparison.
7. **Counterexample** — One real/plausible case that breaks the rule.
8. **Appeal to Authority** — Credible experts, institutions, precedent.
9. **Humor Deflection** — Light wit to diffuse and reframe.
10. **Moral High Ground** — Rights, duties, harm, justice.

> Tip: **Vary tactics** and stay laser-focused on the claim being argued.

## How the Judge Scores

* **Relevance** (on-topic, engages the opponent)
* **Support** (reasons, evidence, examples)
* **Coherence** (clear structure, no leaps)
* **Tactic Fit** (your chosen tactic actually helps)
* **Countering Power** (you addressed their point, not a straw man)

Common pitfalls: false equivalence, category errors, bare assertions.

---

## Tie-Breakers

1. More **round wins**
2. Larger **average margin** of victory
3. Slight **final-round edge** (if enabled)
4. Overall coherence & support (Judge’s summary)

---

## Strategy Hints

* **Frame early** with Logical Reasoning (1) or Analogy (6).
* Follow **Evidence (3)** with a sharp **Counterexample (7)**.
* **Name** the claim you’re refuting; don’t shadow-box.
* Close by **recapping your win conditions**.

## FAQ

**Can I type the tactic name instead of the number?**
Use the number for best reliability.

**Do I have to vary tactics?**
Not required, but variety usually scores better.

**Can I cite sources?**
Yes—keep them brief and relevant.

Each round, choose your argument tactic wisely.

Enter a debate topic (or "random" for AI to choose):

Your argument tactics:

1. Logical Reasoning (systematic logic)
2. Emotional Appeal (pathos)
3. Factual Evidence (concrete data)
4. Rhetorical Question (thought-provoking)
5. Reductio ad Absurdum (show absurdity)
6. Analogy (comparative reasoning)
7. Counterexample (disprove by example)
8. Appeal to Authority (expert opinion)
9. Humor Deflection (wit and charm)
10. Moral High Ground (ethical superiority)

AI uses: logical_reasoning

**AI argues: Your reductio hinges on a false equivalence. Legal personhood isn’t granted to anything that “does computations”; it’s a normative status we assign when an entity plausibly bears rights and duties or can be the subject of interests we’re prepared to protect. Calculators have no autonomy, goals, or capacity to act in the world beyond deterministic operations on inputs; they don’t initiate actions, form intentions, or participate in social and legal relations. By contrast, the (future-possible) AI personhood debate concerns systems that could exhibit goal-directed agency, sustained identity over time, the ability to enter commitments, cause complex real-world effects, and meaningfully benefit or be harmed by legal decisions. Showing that calculators wouldn’t qualify doesn’t refute AI personhood—it clarifies the criteria: agency, interests, accountability, and social participation. If an AI lacks these, it shouldn’t be a person; if it ever met them, dismissing it because calculators don’t would be a category error.**

--- Round Judgment ---
AI wins this round! (7 vs 5)

**Explanation: Your reductio neatly flagged a slippery slope, but it conflated “computational device” with “candidate rights-bearer,” weakening relevance and persuasiveness. The AI counter isolated necessary criteria (agency, interests, accountability) and showed why the calculator comparison doesn’t follow, yielding a clearer, more coherent position.**

=== ROUND 2 ===

Your argument tactics:

1. Logical Reasoning (systematic logic)
2. Emotional Appeal (pathos)
3. Factual Evidence (concrete data)
4. Rhetorical Question (thought-provoking)
5. Reductio ad Absurdum (show absurdity)
6. Analogy (comparative reasoning)
7. Counterexample (disprove by example)
8. Appeal to Authority (expert opinion)
9. Humor Deflection (wit and charm)
10. Moral High Ground (ethical superiority)

Choose your tactic (1-10):
Make your argument:

You said:

**8: No, because then that would grant AI the moral imperative.**

Mind Game said:


AI uses: factual_evidence

**AI argues: “Legal personhood” doesn’t grant a “moral imperative.” Corporations have legal personhood yet no special moral authority; they merely gain standing to own property, enter contracts, sue/be sued, and bear duties. Likewise, some non-humans (e.g., rivers/animals in limited jurisdictions) have been granted person-like standing without any claim to moral superiority. Personhood is a juridical bundle of rights and responsibilities, not a declaration that the entity’s choices are morally binding on others. If anything, extending personhood can increase accountability (clear liability, fiduciary duties), not elevate an entity above moral scrutiny. Therefore, your claim misstates what personhood confers: it’s legal standing, not moral primacy.**

--- Round Judgment ---

AI wins this round! (7 vs 2)

**Explanation: You invoked “appeal to authority” without citing any authority and relied on a category error—confusing legal status with moral supremacy—hurting relevance and support. The AI used concrete counterexamples (corporations, non-human legal persons) to correct the misconception and anchor the debate in verifiable facts.**

## Addendum — How Mind Game Works (AILang Overview)

**Mind Game** is implemented as an **AILang** program executed by an AI runtime. AILang (see the open-source spec at `github.com/pcoz/ailang`) lets authors combine **deterministic** steps (variables, control flow, I/O) with **bounded intelligent** steps (topic selection, argument generation, judging) under explicit constraints.

**Key ideas used by Mind Game:**

* **Deterministic scaffolding:** state like `max_rounds`, menu rendering, round loop, score tally.
* **Intelligent blocks:** constrained generation for AI arguments and a rubric-driven Judge.
* **Rubrics as code:** relevance, support, coherence, tactic-fit, and countering power are spelled out so the “smart” parts remain consistent and auditable.

This hybrid model keeps **rules stable** while allowing **flexible, context-aware debate**.
