Hi team,
For the task assignment in Project Tracker, we need:

Assign tasks to registered users via dropdown (searchable by email/username).
Only project members can be assigned.
Reassignment logs history.

What about notifications? Should we send emails on assignment?
Best,
Dev Lead
Reply (2025-04-03):
Yes to emails. Notification: "You have been assigned task [title] in project [name]. Due: [date]."
Also, add push notifications if mobile app is in scope.

Agreed on email notifs. Use SendGrid for delivery. Ensure opt-out option in user settings.
QA: Test for spam filters.
