File 6: Meeting Notes - Sprint Planning Doc
Type: Google Doc/Word Export (Meeting Notes)
Meeting Title: Sprint 3 Planning for Project Tracker
Date: 2025-06-01
Attendees: PM, Dev Lead, QA, UX
Key Decisions:

Finalize task CRUD: Create/Read/Update/Delete tasks fully implemented.

Update includes changing assignee, due date, status.
Delete only by creator or admin.


Notifications: Email for assignments and due dates only. No SMS yet.
Edge cases: What if assigned user not in project? Auto-add as member.
Next: Integrate with calendar APIs? Defer.

Action Items:

Dev: Update Confluence with priority field addition.
QA: Write tests for dashboard filters.

These simulated files scatter the requirements: e.g., authentication in JIRA PTA-101, project creation in Confluence, assignments and notifications in email/Slack, tasks in multiple places, dashboard in JIRA PTA-205 and notes. In a real scenario, you'd aggregate them for a cohesive spec. If you need more files, variations, or a different system, let me know!2.6sExpert
