Here’s a faithful, end-to-end **simulation of your `small_claims.ail` program** running on the scenario:

* **Incident**: A Tesla in Australia engaged Auto-Park and reversed into a brick wall.
* **Goal**: Owner seeks a **replacement vehicle** from Tesla (primary remedy).
* **Assumption for jurisdiction**: Victoria (VCAT). Where relevant, I note NSW/QLD parallels.

# Simulation Transcript (what the AIL program would output)

## Stage 1 — Fact Clarification

**Legal Advisor**: Thanks for reaching out. I need to understand your situation:

* Where are you located? → *Melbourne, VIC, Australia.*
* Who is the other party? → *Tesla Motors Australia Pty Ltd.*
* What happened? → *On 15 Sep 2025, Auto-Park engaged; vehicle reversed itself into a brick wall; driver hands off pedals/wheel; impact caused rear-end damage; no injury.*
* What resolution do you want? → *Replacement vehicle of the same model/trim; alternatively refund and return.*
* How much money is involved? → *Vehicle RRP ~AUD $64,000; damages and incidental costs ~AUD $6,200.*

**Collected case facts (normalized):**

* **Vehicle**: 2024 Tesla Model 3 RWD; VIN …XXXX; firmware 2025.28.x (as reported in app).
* **Feature at issue**: Auto-Park (reverse park).
* **Evidence available**: Photos of scene; dashcam clips; service report stating “customer claims Auto-Park fault”; logs request submitted; insurance excess paid; correspondence with Tesla service; proof of purchase; firmware/update history.
* **Losses**: Panel/bumper/trunk repair quote; hire car receipts; time off work (if any).
* **Statutory context**: Australian Consumer Law (ACL) consumer guarantees; major failure remedy sought (replacement or refund). ([accc.gov.au][1])

**Opponent model initialized**: “Large manufacturer; process-driven triage; initial stance: *defensive_resistance* (‘no fault / driver error’); high sensitivity to precedent; responsive to regulator/tribunal risk.”

**Initial emotional state (predicted)**: *defensive_resistance → irritation* if pressed; *concern* if shown robust evidence and ACL framing.

---

## Stage 2 — Strategy Development (legal × persuasion map)

**Goal framing under ACL**: A *major failure* allows the consumer to **choose replacement or refund**; warranties don’t limit ACL rights. For motor vehicles, **a major problem entitles replacement/refund at the consumer’s choice**; minor problems → repair. ([accc.gov.au][1])

**We will argue major failure** because:

* The car, with Auto-Park engaged, allegedly **self-caused a collision** in a standard parking context (unsafe; not of acceptable quality; not fit for disclosed purpose; a reasonable consumer may not have purchased knowing this defect). Remedies under ACL are separate from Tesla’s warranty and **override conflicting terms**. ([accc.gov.au][2])

**Persuasion path (opponent emotional waypoints)**:

* *defensive_resistance → evaluation → negotiation_openness → acceptance*
* Triggers: evidence strength (video + logs + expert quote), regulator references (ACCC pages), and credible readiness to file at VCAT.

## Stage 3 — Integrated 2D Navigation Loop

### Move 1 — Send a calibrated **Demand Letter** (with ACL basis)

**Rationale**: Low formality, high clarity; nudges from *defensive_resistance* to *evaluation*.
**Predicted reaction**: request for inspection, offer of repair; attempt to steer to warranty only.

**Communication to send (draft)**

```
To: Tesla Motors Australia Pty Ltd
10 Herbert Street, St Leonards NSW 2065
Email: as per service centre/contact channel

Subject: Australian Consumer Law Notice – Major Failure – Request for Replacement (Tesla Model 3 VIN …XXXX)

I am writing regarding my Tesla Model 3 purchased on [date], VIN …XXXX. On 15 September 2025, while Auto-Park was engaged, the vehicle reversed into a brick wall and sustained rear-end damage. I was not pressing the pedals or steering; Auto-Park controlled the manoeuvre.

Under the Australian Consumer Law (ACL), goods must be of acceptable quality, fit for purpose and free from defects. A vehicle that self-causes a collision during a standard auto-parking manoeuvre is unsafe and not of acceptable quality. This constitutes a major failure under the ACL. When there is a major failure, consumers are entitled to choose a replacement or refund; manufacturer warranty terms do not limit these statutory rights.

Remedy sought (my election): REPLACEMENT vehicle of the same model/spec within 14 days, plus reimbursement of consequential losses (repairs quote attached, hire car costs, and any other reasonable expenses).

Evidence attached: photos, dashcam clip, service notes, proof of purchase, firmware version, and a request for vehicle logs contemporaneous with the incident.

If I do not receive a satisfactory response within 14 days, I will escalate through Consumer Affairs Victoria and file at VCAT without further notice.

Sincerely,
[Your name, address, email, phone]

*Legal basis references for inclusion in footnotes:* ACCC “Cars and vehicles” (major problem → consumer’s choice of replacement/refund); “Repair, replace, refund, cancel” overview; Tesla’s warranty acknowledging ACL statutory rights. ([accc.gov.au][1])

**Expected emotional shift**: *defensive_resistance → evaluation*.

---

### Move 2 — Negotiation Round (if Tesla offers repair only)

**Our calibrated reply** (keeps pressure while staying reasonable):

* Re-state **consumer’s election** of remedy for a major failure (replacement) and that repair is insufficient for a *major* failure.
* Offer **structured fallback**, without conceding major failure:

  * Option A: **Replacement** within 14 days + loan car until delivery + cover incidentals.
  * Option B: **Refund & return** (full purchase price incl. on-roads) + costs.
  * Option C (without prejudice): **Buy-back less usage** only if major-failure is contested and we wish to end quickly.

**Predicted reaction**: If evidence/logs support our narrative and VCAT risk is credible, emotional state moves to *negotiation_openness*. ([The Australian][3])

---

### Move 3 — **Prepare to File** (VCAT – Goods & Services)

If unresolved in ~14 days, we file. **Time limits**: typically **within 6 years**; special **3-month** limit applies only if you seek to revoke a car sale < $40k (we’re electing replacement/refund for major failure; revocation timing note still useful). ([vcat.vic.gov.au][4])

**Filing pack (program-generated checklist):**

* Applicant details, Respondent: *Tesla Motors Australia Pty Ltd, 10 Herbert St, St Leonards NSW 2065* (from Tesla AU warranty). ([Tesla][5])
* Orders sought: **Replacement** (primary), or **refund** (alternative), plus **costs** and **incidental damages**.
* Grounds: ACL consumer guarantees (acceptable quality, fit for purpose, safety); **major failure** rationale and evidence index. ([accc.gov.au][1])
* Evidence bundle: incident narrative, photos, dashcam clip, service records, firmware/version notes, independent panel quote, hire-car receipts, correspondence, and **request/produced vehicle logs**.

**Predicted emotional shift**: *evaluation → concern*.

---

### Move 4 — Hearing Preparation

**Plan**:

* Brief, fact-first chronology; show **Auto-Park on**, no manual input, immediate reverse collision.
* Demonstrate **safety defect** → major failure; cite **ACCC motor vehicle guidance** (consumer chooses replacement/refund for major problem). ([accc.gov.au][1])
* Pre-empt “warranty-only” defences with **ACL supremacy** (statutory rights cannot be excluded). ([accc.gov.au][2])
* If Tesla disputes causation, request **vehicle logs disclosure**; if unavailable, rely on **dashcam + witness** + consistent narrative, and argue adverse inference.

**Predicted emotional shift**: *concern → negotiation_openness/resignation*.

---

### Move 5 — Settlement & Closure

**Program’s settlement generator** proposes:

* **Preferred**: Replacement delivered within 14 days; Tesla pays repair/hire-car/filing fees; no admission of liability; mutual confidentiality.
* **Alternative**: Refund + return; or buy-back on agreed terms.

**Template settlement clause (excerpt)**:

```
Tesla Motors Australia Pty Ltd agrees to provide a replacement Tesla Model 3 [spec] to [Owner] within 14 days of execution, transfer registration at Tesla’s cost, and reimburse $[X] in incidental losses (Schedule 1). The parties release all claims arising from the incident on 15 Sep 2025. This agreement is made without admission of liability and is confidential except as required by law or for tax/financial advice.
```

**Journey status**: **Resolution ready** (negotiate or proceed to hearing).

---

## Evidence Matrix (what the program stores/organises)

* **Primary**: Dashcam clip (front/rear), photos of damage and wall, proof of Auto-Park engagement (screen UX, chime/logs), service booking notes, firmware version/time.
* **Secondary**: Independent repair quotes, hire-car receipts, correspondence timeline.
* **Legal Authorities (for bundle tabs)**:
  – ACCC **Cars & vehicles** (major problem → replacement/refund at consumer’s choice). ([accc.gov.au][1])
  – ACCC **Repair/replace/refund** explainer (statutory remedies). ([accc.gov.au][2])
  – Tesla AU warranty page noting **ACL rights apply in addition**. ([Tesla][5])
  – VCAT **before you apply** (timing incl. 6-year general and 3-month revocation note). ([vcat.vic.gov.au][4])

---

## Risk & Counter-moves (program’s forecast)

* **Tesla says “no defect; driver error”** → press for **vehicle logs**; show consistent evidence; stress safety + ACL major failure.
* **Tesla offers repair only** → reiterate **consumer’s election** under ACL for major failure; keep replacement/refund on the table. ([accc.gov.au][1])
* **Delay tactics** → firm timelines; note intention to file; actually file to shift to *concern/resignation*.

---

## Compact Next-Actions Checklist (what the program would ask you to do now)

1. **Send the demand letter** (above) with attachments; give **14 days**.
2. **Request vehicle logs** from Tesla for the incident timestamp.
3. **If no satisfactory offer**: file a **VCAT** goods & services application seeking **replacement (primary) / refund (alt)** + costs. ([vcat.vic.gov.au][4])
4. **Prepare bundle**: evidence matrix + short chronology + ACCC references. ([accc.gov.au][1])

---

## Notes on Law (why replacement is credible here)

* Under the **ACL**, a car with a **major problem** gives the consumer the **choice** of *replacement or refund*. Warranties don’t limit these rights. ([accc.gov.au][1])
* **Tesla’s AU warranty** explicitly states it’s **in addition** to statutory guarantees (not in substitution). ([Tesla][5])
* If filing in **Victoria**, VCAT time limits generally run to **6 years** (revocation of sale < $40k has a 3-month window—usually when rejecting the car outright). ([vcat.vic.gov.au][4])

---

### Quick adaptions if you’re not in Victoria

* **NSW** → NCAT Consumer & Commercial Division (Motor vehicles).
* **QLD** → QCAT (Minor civil dispute—consumer/trader).
  (Substance under ACL is the same; forms, fees, and names differ.)
