## AILang Extension A: Person Systems Reference
Person entities represent computational agents with human-like attributes, enabling sophisticated modeling of individuals within AILang programs. Persons combine deterministic state management with intelligent behavioral modeling.

### Person Class Definition

```
#ailang
CLASS Person:
    # Core attributes
    PROPERTIES:
        id: unique_identifier
        name: text
        age: number
        gender: text
        background: PersonBackground
        current_state: PersonState
    
    # Initialize person with basic attributes
    CONSTRUCTOR(name, age, gender, background_data):
        SET this.id TO generate_unique_id()
        SET this.name TO name
        SET this.age TO age
        SET this.gender TO gender
        SET this.background TO NEW PersonBackground(background_data)
        SET this.current_state TO NEW PersonState()
    END_CONSTRUCTOR
END_CLASS
```

### E1.1 Basic Attributes
**Note on Basic Attributes:** These systems model fundamental cognitive, communicative, and physical capabilities. Most capabilities involve subjective states (mental load, energy, coordination) that are described qualitatively rather than measured on arbitrary numeric scales. Skill proficiency and language abilities use descriptive levels that the AI can interpret contextually.

### E1.2 Experience System (Sensory)
**Note on Sensory Modeling:** This section models how persons perceive their environment through multiple sensory channels. While some measurements are genuinely quantifiable (field of view in degrees, actual distances), the quality and acuity of sensory perception varies individually and contextually. These subjective perceptual capacities are described qualitatively, allowing the AI to interpret sensory capabilities and limitations appropriately.

### E1.3 Memory System
**Note on Memory Modeling:** This section models how persons encode, store, and retrieve memories across different memory systems. While working memory capacity has genuine empirical grounding (Miller's 7±2), most aspects of memory involve subjective qualities—how vividly we recall, how easily we access memories, how strongly emotions are associated. These are best described qualitatively, allowing contextually-appropriate interpretation rather than false numeric precision.

### E1.4 Personality System (Logos, Energiae, Ethos)
The personality system models three fundamental dimensions of human character that interact dynamically to shape behavior and experience. These are qualitative dimensions, not numeric scales—they represent patterns of being rather than measurable quantities.

#### Conceptual Foundation
* **Logos (Rational Principle)**: The reasoning, pattern-seeking, truth-oriented aspect of personality. How a person makes sense of the world intellectually.
* **Energiae (Active Forces)**: The drives, vitality, motivations, and creative energy that propel action. The life force and spontaneity.
* **Ethos (Moral Character)**: Values, principles, conscience, and moral orientation. What matters to the person and how they navigate right and wrong.

These dimensions are inspired by classical philosophy and psychological frameworks like Transactional Analysis, but should be understood as conceptual tools for modeling behavior, not validated psychological metrics.

### E1.6 Economic Awareness System
**Note on Economic Modeling:** Unlike personality traits which lack natural units, economic concepts often have genuine quantitative measurements (dollars, percentages, dates). However, **subjective economic attitudes** (risk tolerance, emotional attachment to possessions, perceived utility) should be qualitative descriptors rather than numeric scales.

**Note on Knowledge Modeling:** This section models how persons learn, retain expertise, and acquire new knowledge. While **learning outcomes** can be measured objectively (test scores, skill demonstrations), the **psychological dimensions** of learning—curiosity, learning rate, cognitive style—are subjective qualities that are described qualitatively rather than quantified on arbitrary scales.

### E1.8 Planning and Action System
**Note on Planning Modeling:** This section models goal-directed behavior and adaptive navigation. While some planning metrics are genuinely measurable (time elapsed, completion percentage, resource consumption), the cognitive and personality dimensions of planning—flexibility, strategic thinking style, adaptability—are qualitative characteristics that vary contextually rather than fixed quantities.

### E1.9 Background and Demographics
**Note on Identity Modeling:** This section captures factual biographical information and legal identifiers. Most properties here are objective facts (dates, addresses, document numbers) that don't require revision. However, a few subjective assessments (language proficiency, trust levels, identity confidence scores) are represented as qualitative descriptors.

### E1.10 Group Membership System
**Note on Group Modeling:** This section models how persons relate to social groups—families, organizations, communities. Some properties are factual (group size, joined date, hierarchical reporting structure), while others represent subjective psychological states (commitment level, identification strength, group cohesion). The latter use qualitative descriptors rather than numeric scales to avoid false precision about complex social-psychological phenomena.

### E1.13 Person Implementation Notes

The Person entity system integrates with existing AILang constructs:

1. **Deterministic State**: Person properties follow deterministic rules for state changes
2. **Intelligent Behavior**: Decision-making and interactions use INTELLIGENTLY modifiers
3. **Memory Persistence**: Person state can be serialized and restored across sessions
4. **Scalability**: Multiple persons can interact within the same program scope
5. **Extensibility**: New attributes and capabilities can be added through inheritance

The Person class provides a comprehensive framework for modeling human-like agents while maintaining AILang's balance between deterministic computation and intelligent adaptation.
